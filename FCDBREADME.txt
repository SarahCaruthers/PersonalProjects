This DataBase mimics a used car auction site, without the use of a third party credit service or the establishment of
an independent server. Actions in which the third party credit service would take over are noted during run-time and
the application will not commit any further actions until the current transaction is quit.

For future improvements, a server will be set up to send email notifications to necessary users when a sale is made.
A third party credit service will be wired in if legitimate transactions were to take place.
